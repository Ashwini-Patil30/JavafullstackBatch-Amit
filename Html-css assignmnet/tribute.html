A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, (born October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, 
India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong), Indian scientist and politician who 
played a leading role in the development of India’s missile and nuclear weapons programs. 
He was president of India from 2002 to 2007.<p>
<p>Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology 
and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). 
In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of 
the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and 
produced in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a 
number of successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname “Missile Man.” 
Among those successes was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, 
which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.<p>
<p>In 2002 India’s ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) put forward Kalam to succeed outgoing 
President Kocheril Raman Narayanan. Kalam was nominated by the Hindu nationalist (Hindutva) NDA even though 
he was Muslim, and his stature and popular appeal were such that even the main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, 
also proposed his candidacy. Kalam easily won the election and was sworn in as India’s 11th president, 
a largely ceremonial post, in July 2002. He left office at the end of his term in 2007 and was succeeded by Pratibha Patil, 
the country’s first woman president.</p>
